# Movie Ticket Booking System — Testing Guide

## Architecture Overview

```
Client → API Gateway (8765)
              ↓
         Booking Service (8080)  ← Eureka (8761)
              ↓ [Kafka: payment-request topic]
         Payment Service (8081)
              ↓ [Stripe API]
              ↓ [Kafka: payment-response topic]
         Booking Service (updates booking status)
```

**Databases:** MySQL (`bookings` DB for booking-service, `payments` DB for payment-service)  
**Message Broker:** 3-node Kafka cluster + Zookeeper  
**Service Discovery:** Eureka

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Java 17 + Maven (only needed for local runs)
- `curl` or Postman for API testing

---

## Step 1 — Start Everything

```bash
cd Movie-Ticket-Booking-System-FIXED

# Build and start all services
docker compose up --build

# Or run in background:
docker compose up --build -d
```

Expected startup order (Docker handles this via depends_on):
1. Zookeeper → Kafka brokers → init-kafka (creates topics)
2. MySQL
3. Eureka Server
4. API Gateway
5. Payment Service
6. Booking Service
7. Notification Service

**Tip:** First build takes ~5–10 minutes for Maven downloads.

---

## Step 2 — Verify Services Are Up

### Check Eureka Dashboard
Open in browser: http://localhost:8761

You should see all registered services:
- `BOOKING-SERVICE`
- `PAYMENT-SERVICE`
- `API-GATEWAY`
- `NOTIFICATION-SERVICE`

### Check Health Endpoints
```bash
curl http://localhost:8765/actuator/health   # API Gateway
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health   # Booking Service (direct)
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health   # Payment Service (direct)
curl http://localhost:8761/actuator/health   # Eureka Server
```

All should return: `{"status":"UP"}`

---

## Step 3 — Happy Path Test (Full Booking Flow)

### 3.1 Create a Booking via API Gateway

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user-001",
    "movieId": 42,
    "seatsBooked": ["A1", "A2"],
    "showDate": "2025-12-25",
    "showTime": "18:30:00",
    "bookingAmount": 25.00
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "bookingId": "some-uuid-here",
  "userId": "user-001",
  "movieId": 42,
  "seatsBooked": ["A1", "A2"],
  "showDate": "2025-12-25",
  "showTime": "18:30:00",
  "bookingStatus": "PENDING",
  "bookingAmount": 25.00
}
```

The booking is saved as `PENDING` and a Kafka message is published to `payment-request`.

### 3.2 What Happens Asynchronously

1. **Payment Service** picks up the message from `payment-request` topic
2. Calls **Stripe** with `tok_visa` test token (auto-succeeds in test mode)
3. Sets status → `CONFIRMED`, saves PaymentEntity as `APPROVED`
4. Publishes result to `payment-response` Kafka topic
5. **Booking Service** listener updates the booking record to `CONFIRMED`

---

## Step 4 — Validate Database Records

### Connect to MySQL
```bash
docker exec -it mysql mysql -uroot -proot
```

### Check Booking Record
```sql
USE bookings;
SELECT booking_id, user_id, movie_id, booking_status, booking_amount FROM bookings;
```
After a few seconds the status should change from `PENDING` → `CONFIRMED`.

### Check Payment Record
```sql
USE payments;
SELECT payment_id, booking_id, payment_status, payment_amount, created_time FROM payments;
```
Should show `APPROVED` status.

---

## Step 5 — Validation Tests

### 5.1 Missing Required Fields (should return 400)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "movieId": 42
  }'
```

**Expected Response (400 Bad Request):**
```json
{
  "code": "Bad Request",
  "errorMessage": [
    "UserId is mendatory and it cannot be blank",
    "user must have booked at least 1 seat",
    "show date Is mandatory",
    "show time Is mandatory",
    "booking amount is mandatory"
  ]
}
```

### 5.2 Negative Amount (should return 400)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user-002",
    "movieId": 1,
    "seatsBooked": ["B1"],
    "showDate": "2025-12-25",
    "showTime": "20:00:00",
    "bookingAmount": -10.00
  }'
```
**Expected:** 400 — `amount must be greater than zero`

---

## Step 6 — Circuit Breaker Test

### 6.1 Stop the Booking Service
```bash
docker stop booking-service
```

### 6.2 Hit the Gateway
```bash
curl http://localhost:8765/bookings
```

**Expected Response (fallback):**
```
Booking Service is in maintenance mode. Please try after some time
```

### 6.3 Restore
```bash
docker start booking-service
```

---

## Step 7 — Direct Payment Service Test (REST fallback)

You can also call payment-service directly (bypasses Kafka):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bookingId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
    "userId": "user-001",
    "movieId": 1,
    "seatsBooked": ["C1"],
    "showDate": "2025-12-25",
    "showTime": "19:00:00",
    "bookingAmount": 15.00
  }'
```

---

## Step 8 — View Kafka Topics (Optional)

```bash
# List topics
docker exec kafka-broker-1 kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

# Watch payment-request messages live
docker exec kafka-broker-1 kafka-console-consumer \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic payment-request \
  --from-beginning

# Watch payment-response messages live
docker exec kafka-broker-1 kafka-console-consumer \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic payment-response \
  --from-beginning
```

---

## Step 9 — Shutdown

```bash
docker compose down            # stop containers
docker compose down -v         # stop + delete volumes (wipes DB data)
```

## Bugs Fixed (Summary)

| # | Location | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|-------|-----|
| 1 | `IBookingService` | `@Service` on an interface causes Spring conflict | Removed |
| 2 | `IPaymentService` | `@RequestBody` annotation on service interface method | Removed |
| 3 | `PaymentServiceBroker` | `@Component` redundant on `@FeignClient`; wrong `CommonsLog` import; unused `@GetMapping` import | Cleaned |
| 4 | `PaymentServiceImpl` | Kafka publisher wired out (commented); payment entity status never re-saved; `NPE` risk on null booking status | All fixed |
| 5 | `BookingServiceKafkaListener` / `PaymentServiceKafkaListener` | `PaymentServiceKafkaListener` entirely missing | Created |
| 6 | `PaymentServiceKafkaPublisher` | Entire class missing | Created |
| 7 | `StripePaymentGateway` | Amount sent in dollars; Stripe requires cents (× 100). Trailing space in `"tok_visa "` | Fixed |
| 8 | `booking-service/application.yaml` | `?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true` inside env-var default breaks URL parsing; hardcoded Kafka host list not injectable; missing `trusted.packages` | Fixed |
| 9 | `payment-service/application.yaml` | Same URL bug; Kafka not injectable; missing `trusted.packages`; Stripe key hardcoded | Fixed |
| 10 | `docker-compose.yml` | No MySQL service; no Kafka/Zookeeper; no DB env vars; `booking-service` depended on `api-gateway` (wrong); notification-service commented out | Fully rebuilt |
| 11 | `payment-service/pom.xml` | Missing `spring-kafka` dependency | Added |
| 12 | All service `pom.xml` files | Invalid XML tag `<n>` should be `<n>` | Fixed |
| 13 | `LoggerConstants` | `EXITING_SERVICE_MESSAGE` had wrong copy-pasted message text | Fixed |
| 14 | `BookingControllerFallbackApi` | Unused `reactor.core.publisher.Mono` import (causes compile warning) | Removed |
